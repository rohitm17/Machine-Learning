 OpenCV (Open Source Computer Vision) is a library of programming functions mainly aimed at real-time computer vision. 
 In simple language it is library used for Image Processing. It is mainly used to do all the operation related to Images.
 It mainly focuses on image processing, video capture and analysis including features like face detection and object detection.
  
 Computer Vision overlaps significantly with the following fields −

  1)Image Processing − It focuses on image manipulation.

  2)Pattern Recognition − It explains various techniques to classify patterns.

  3)Photogrammetry − It is concerned with obtaining accurate measurements from images.
  
  
<b>Image processing</b> is a method to perform some operations on an image, in order to get an enhanced image or to extract some useful information from it.
It is a type of signal processing in which input is an image and output may be image or characteristics/features associated with that image.
